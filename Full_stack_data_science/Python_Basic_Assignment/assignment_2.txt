1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
A: True, False

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
A: and, or, not

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
A: or-
    True or True: True , True or False: True, False or True: True, False or False: False
   and-
    True and True: True, True and False: False, False and True: False, False and False: False

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
A: False
not (5 > 4)
A: False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
A: True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
A: False
(True and True) and (True == False)
A: False
(not False) or (not True)
A: True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
A: ==, >, <, >=, <=, !=

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
A: '=' assignment operator assigns a value to a variable while '==' equal to operator checks 
    if two values are equal and returns a bool. 
    a=3 (we are assigning 3 to a)
    a==3 ( we are checking if a is equal to 3)

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

A: two if blocks and one else block

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

A:
if spam==1:
    print("Hello")
elif spam==2:
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greeting")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
A: ctrl+call

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
A: break will come out of the loop block 
    continue will go back to the first line of the loop block

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
A: They all return a list of integers from 0 to 9
    
12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
A:
    for i in range(1,11):
        print(i)
    

    i=0
    while(i<11)
        print(i)
        i+=1
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

spam.bacon()
